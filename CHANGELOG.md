# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

From version 1.1.0 onwards this file follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) conventions.
Older entries below are preserved as originally written.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- `WifiAuthMode` now includes `WPA3_PSK` (6) and `WPA2_WPA3_PSK` (7), matching
  ESP-IDF v5's `wifi_constants.proto`. Previously these decoded as the unknown-
  enum default `Open`, so WPA3 and WPA2/WPA3-mixed access points were reported
  as open networks (`WifiAP.private == false`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `Security0` class implementing the no-encryption (`SecScheme0`) provisioning
  handshake, for use with ESP32 firmware configured without encryption.
- `Security0State` enum (`step0Request`, `step0Response`) tracking the
  two-step Security0 session state machine.
- Unit tests for `Security0`: encrypt/decrypt identity, state transitions,
  correct protobuf output, and error handling in session response processing.
- Security mode selector in the example app: users can choose between
  Security0 (no encryption) and Security1 (encrypted) at the connect screen,
  with the proof-of-possession field shown only when Security1 is selected.

### Changed

- `ProvSecurity.securitySession` parameter changed from `SessionData` to
  `SessionData?` to reflect that the first call in a session has no prior
  response to pass.
